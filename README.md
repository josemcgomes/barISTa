Human-Machine Interfaces project. The goal was to create an interface for a touchscreen on a caf√© table which would take orders directly from customers, instead of having them wait for the waiter to come. Payment was also implemented so the customers can pay using their preferred method. Note: Some methods assume the table is equipped with additional hardware, like paying in cash, where coin slots are needed.

It is also possible to keep a tab on the current and previous orders and to pay someone else's tab in the same table (there is an individual screen for each place).

Menu is currently in Portuguese.
